#  Hi, I'm Jorai Thomas  
2nd Year Computer Science student @ University of Surrey  
Passionate about Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Automation.
Currently developing projects across Python, Java, C++, and Web Development while strengthening my foundations in algorithms, systems, and embedded programming.
Building projects in Python, Java, and Web Development  
Always eager to learn from others

### Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, SQL  
- **Frameworks:** Flask, Node.js, Express  
- **Tools:** Git, MySQL, VS Code, IntelliJ, Raspberry Pi Pico
- **Interests:** Robotics • AI • Embedded Systems • Automation

###  Current Focus
- BFS/A* Pathfinding Visualiser (Python)
- Ultrasonic Distance System (Raspberry Pi Pico)
- NeetCode DSA Practice – Arrays, Hash Maps, Recursion
- C++ Fundamentals Labs – Pointers, References, Modular Programming
- Java Algorithm Labs – Divide and Conquer (QuickSort, Kth Smallest)
- Upcoming: Home Server setup and ROS simulations

### Projects & Coursework
- I actively document both university coursework and personal learning projects on GitHub, covering topics from full-stack web apps and algorithms to embedded systems.
- See Repositories for Personal Projects and Coursework Documentations
- See 'Projects' for my Learning and Projects Roadmap for 2025/26

### Learning Roadmap
- Short-Term Goals:
- Complete BFS/A* Pathfinding Visualiser and Pico Ultrasonic Project
- Continue NeetCode practice for DSA fluency
- Polish and document C++ and Java lab repositories

Mid-Term Goals:
- Build a Linux-based home server for self-hosted applications
- Begin ROS simulations and simple robotics control projects
- Expand portfolio with applied AI and embedded system integrations
