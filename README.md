###  Current Focus
- BFS/A* Pathfinding Visualiser (Python)
- Ultrasonic Distance System (Raspberry Pi Pico)
- NeetCode DSA Practice – Arrays, Hash Maps, Recursion
- C++ Fundamentals Labs – Pointers, References, Modular Programming
- Upcoming: Home Server setup and ROS simulations

### Projects & Coursework
- I actively document both university coursework and personal learning projects on GitHub, covering topics from full-stack web apps and algorithms to embedded systems.
- See Repositories for Personal Projects and Coursework Documentations

### Learning Roadmap
- Short-Term Goals:
- Complete BFS/A* Pathfinding Visualiser and Pico Ultrasonic Project
- Continue NeetCode practice for DSA fluency
- Polish and document C++ and Java lab repositories

Mid-Term Goals:
- Build a Linux-based home server for self-hosted applications
- Begin ROS simulations and simple robotics control projects
- Expand portfolio with applied AI and embedded system integrations
